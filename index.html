      This form was created for staff to understand they are held to higher standards than regular players, and for the community to see that NovaQuest is fully transparent regarding staff actions and any issues that may arise. It includes updates on rules, staff demotions, and other relevant matters, while demonstrating our commitment to keeping the NovaQuest community safe, fair, and enjoyable for everyone.

        <li>Prioritize staff responsibilities over gameplay: respond to player questions, tickets, and reports promptly.</li>
        <li>Earn or buy all items/ranks like regular players unless officially rewarded by the founder (Puchu AFK).</li>
        <li>Maintain professionalism in all interactions with players and staff.</li>
        <li>Follow all hierarchy rules — lower staff report to higher staff as defined in this guide.</li>
        <li>Do not hint at promotions — all promotions are decided by management and the founder.</li>
        <li>Do not leak confidential information (staff tickets, staff Discord, internal discussions):
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>Admin+ leaking staff info → instant demotion</li>
            <li>Leaking management server info → immediate removal from network</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Report bugs within 24 hours. Using unreported bugs for personal gain is a strikeable offense.</li>
        <li>Do not close tickets prematurely; tickets may only be closed if:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>The player hasn’t replied within 24 hours</li>
            <li>The player is uncooperative as determined by management</li>
