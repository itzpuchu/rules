It includes updates on rules, staff demotions, and other relevant matters, while demonstrating our commitment to keeping the NovaQuest community safe, fair, and enjoyable for everyone.

This document is binding for all staff. Compliance is mandatory. Failure to follow any rule results in consequences that are objective and consistently enforced, without exceptions.`,

• Earn or buy all items/ranks like regular players unless officially rewarded by the founder (Puchu AFK).
• Maintain professionalism in all interactions with players and staff.
• Follow all hierarchy rules — lower staff report to higher staff as defined in this guide.
• Do not hint at promotions — all promotions are decided by management and the founder.
• Do not leak confidential information (staff tickets, staff Discord, internal discussions).
  - Admin+ leaking staff info → instant demotion
  - Leaking management server info → immediate removal from network
• Report bugs within 24 hours. Using unreported bugs for personal gain is a strikeable offense.
• Do not close tickets prematurely; tickets may only be closed if:
  - The player hasn’t replied within 24 hours
  - The player is uncooperative as determined by management`,

• Strikeable offenses include (but are not limited to):
  - Impolite behavior toward players or staff
  - Misuse of staff commands (trolling, unfair advantage)
  - Failure to report bugs or misuse of unreported bugs
  - Leaking confidential information`,

• Issues escalating between staff and players must be reported to management if widespread.
• Staff may not use admin/staff commands for personal gain, trolling, or assisting friends.
• All actions taken must be documented if requested by management.`,
